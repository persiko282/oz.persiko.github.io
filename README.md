01 About
\
\ I\'92m a sound technician and musician with a deep passion for electronic music and sonic culture. \ Based in Leipzig and active across Europe, I use sound to express myself, shape atmosphere, \ and connect people, cultures, and ideas. My musical focus includes world music, funky grooves, \ reggae, and dub \'97 always aiming for warmth, groove, and authenticity.\

\
\ Beyond playing and mixing music, I enjoy creating spaces where ideas grow \'97 combining art, \ events, and community into meaningful experiences.\

\
\ I support festivals and productions such as Ancient Trance Festival, New Vision Festival, \ Cumbia Ton e.V., and many other inspiring projects. I also play drums with my band Maki-Roots, \ exploring rhythm as a form of expression and connection.\
